RE: The real problem with AI writing.

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
Does my work suffer from using AI to write for me?

## SHORT ANSWER: 
Yes. Using AI to write is now being shown to lead to converging results. We all end up with similar structure and arguments. So what is the point of writing arguments for a living if you leave the argument for someone else.

## DISCUSSION

"Walker, there is no path; the path is made by walking."
[Traveler, your footprints]
Antonio Machado

The internet is full of blog posts espousing the power of using Large Language Models like ChatGPT as creative collaborators. Of course, AI can and effectively does produce first drafts for use in the editing process. But what happens when we use AI as a colloaborator? Do we get better ideas? Or do we converge on the same basic ideas and output?

#### AI Model Convergance
(person who published this) published an interesting case study that implicates this idea. The study used a wide range of available LLMs and asked them open-ended questioons designed to illicit varying responses. 

The use cases studied in this paper are important to those of us in a line of work that requires creative writing. What value can AI bring?

How does this implicate attorneys?

We attorneys are paid for our analyses and argument. Legal argument may not seem ripe for creative potential, but creativity is required for novel arguments and interpretations. If we attorneys are all converging on the same analyses and argument because we are allowing LLMs to unduely influence our thoughts, what is the point? What, really, is the point of working as an advocate if you are not going to advocate?

Perhaps human influence will become more important in the future. As automated systems take hold in the insurance industry we may end up in a world where inhuman intelligence argues itself into an impasse. This reduction in human oversight leads my [[Adversarial Demand Letter Research]] and [[AI Adversarial Tech]] series. If we are involved in an intellectual arms race against insurance companies, I will come prepared.

#### AI (LLMs) Cannot Forge a New Path
The predictive nature of Large Language Models ensures that they do not make their path by walking--they make it by retreading all previous paths. You are highly likely not to generate novel ideas in the legal realm if you use AI to write. You not only atrophy your most valuable asset, you leave the reasoning up to systems that have been shown to converge on the same ideas.

This certainly works in some legal contexts. Contract interpretation walks many of the same paths ad infinitum. Advocacy requires something different. Human persuasion often requires something more than the same.

Keep writing.

I assert the true value of generative AI is for repetitive tasks or data sets that cannot be meaninfullly comprehended or mined for information by a limited staff. Discovery analysis is a great example.
