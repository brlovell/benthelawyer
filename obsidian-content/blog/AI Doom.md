RE: Will Artificial Super Intelligence end humanity?

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
What impact does the massive buildout of AI infrastructure and data centers have on your local community.

## SHORT ANSWER: 
It is certainly possible and probable. Without any meaningful regulation or discussion of the risks on an international scale, something negative seems likely. We may be outsmarting ourselves and overestimating our control of the situation. 


If anybody builds it, everyone dies. It's all in the title of the book that sparked this debate

## DISCUSSION


How does the AI doom apply to the practice of law? Should I be writing articles about how the underlying technology should concern people, especially lawyers?
