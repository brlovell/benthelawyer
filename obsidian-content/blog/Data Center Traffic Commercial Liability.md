RE: Data Centers and AI's Impact on Communities

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
What impacts do the massive buildout of AI infrastructure and data centers have on your local community.

## SHORT ANSWER: 
Probable increase in truck and car crashes with increased traffic. Data centers are under construction is many rural areas because land is cheaper and local opposition is less likely. These projects may increase commercial vehicle traffic on interstates and especially local roads, possibly leading to an increase in car and truck crashes.

## DISCUSSION

Outline: 
- Data centers increase traffic and subcontractors. If you are injured by a truck from a different company this is third party liability
- It's dangerous for the truckers too
- So many sub contractors make things confusing
