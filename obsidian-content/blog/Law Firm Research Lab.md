RE: How can attorneys become researchers to answer important case questions?

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
How can AI help attorneys research case specific questions to better understand their case or develop questions for an expert?

## SHORT ANSWER: 
Create a Law Firm Research Lab and us AI tools to design and run experiements on data. This can be as simple as you on your laptop or a commercial server setup to run your own AI models without uploading sensitive or priviledged information to the cloud.

## DISCUSSION

#### What is a Law Firm Research Lab?
Why is research lab and law firm in the same sentence? With the advent and acceleration of AI reasoning workflows I feel it is more important than ever that small law firms dedicate some of their resources to AI research.

#### What do you mean by research lab?
A computer system powerful enough to run and train local AI models. You can leverage the power of your own data and build products to solve problems indivial to your firm.

You need to be using your breadth of domain knowledge, gathered from practicing law and deposing experts, and use the new tools available to quickly answer questions that may not have been possible before.

## Law firms possess valuable data. 

When a legal tech vendor contacts you trying to sell you their product, they are mostly interested in your expertise and data to train their AI system. You bring value to the table. You data is valuable for large legal tech companies to train and ostensibly improve their models. The lawyers at those firms hold something even more valuable: expertise. Legal tech companies are desperate for real legal experience to enhance their training data. They use what is called reinforcement learning to enhance their performance. Law firms are paying these legal tech companies to mine their expertise for commercial gain.

## Being a good lawyer requires continuous learning. 

We have to become temporary experts on a variety of topics to depose experts. A law firm research lab enables pre-expert research. You or the lawyers at your firm can process data in a variety of ways to gain insight. 
		- Analyze information you already have
		- Get quick answers to questions 
		- Learn more about a subject to know what to ask your expert.

## A recent example
I wanted to know if there was an increase in traffic in the Texas panhandle as more and more proposed data center construction projects started taking shape. I want to know whether collisions have increased in the area in the past 5 years. So, I designed research software to analyze county level traffic data around data center sites. You can find the results in my article about [[Data Center Traffic Commercial Liability]] and [[Data Centers and AI Impacts on Communities]].

I created commercial-level case tracking software to solve my specific problems


## How to set up your own

You don't need much. You can use a laptop to run local AI models or you can build a supercomputer. Price and power are the limiting factors. 

I am writing a series on my own research lab here. The series explores multiple options from just asking different AI models the same questions to context engineering for better responses. You can follow along as I build a specialized research computer capable of running local AI models, ensuring our firm's confidential data never gets uploaded to the cloud. 

#### My research lab(s)
My test system is just my laptop. I complete most of my projects using Google's Anti Gravity IDE (a program used to help write software) and Google Gemini combined with Claude Code. 
My research system is simply a computer I built from spare parts and a powerful graphics card I ordered used on ebay. A bit more technical know how is required to run your own computer but commercial products such as NVIDA's dgx spark and Apple's Mac Mini clusters are lowering the technical barrier to entry. 

#### The Benefits of a personal Research System
I can process my data locally without handing over my files to another provider. 
I can integrate the latest research directly into my projects
Customizations. I can solve specific problems that would normally require enterprise software. 

I wanted to track trial preparation progress on a few cases headed to trial in 2026. In a matter of days I created basic case tracking and management software that suited my needs. I can customize this software in any way I see fit--move anything in the user interface, add new features, etc. If I can imagine it, I can find a way to build something that will get the job done.

The drawbacks of a personal research system
Power and sophistication. Open source AI models are not as capable as those of Google and Anthropic. Google essentially invented the AI tools we use today and their product will give you better results for a price.

You may not need the latest and greatest to achieve good results.
You don't need Gemini 3 pro to process a PDF and extract useful information such as deadlines. You can use smaller models that you can run on your home computer to achieve the same results.
