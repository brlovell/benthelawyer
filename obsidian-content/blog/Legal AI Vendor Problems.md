RE: Will Artificial Super Intelligence end humanity?

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
What impact does the massive buildout of AI infrastructure and data centers have on your local community.

## SHORT ANSWER: 
Legal tech vendors are not a member of your firm and do not know your data like you do. They want your data and knowledge by correcting their output but they cannot solve the particular problems you are facing with custom solutions. They have a few big and good solutions.

## DISCUSSION
Large AI companies are extracting value from you. This is the playbook of tech companies that inevitably plays out. And I do mean inevitably (link to enshittification). You pay a monthly fee or pay a marginal fee on a case-by-case basis and the company trains their model on your usage. What this ultimately means is that once the model is sufficiently intelligent as a result of your work and usage, the price will increase and its value to you will diminish.

Building custom AI solutions solves this problem. You train and improve your model on your data. You don't depend on a third party with leverage over your data.


The problem with building a custom solution is scalability and maintenance. I use AI tools to solve individual problems and add value tomy cases. Were I to continuously maintain this software with a user base, I would be a software engineer and not a lawyer. I don't want to spend my time tracking and fixing bugs in software.
