RE: How does AI work and why do I care?

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
How does it benefit me to better understand how AI chatbots answer my questions?

## SHORT ANSWER: 
AI Models work as predicitive machines. The nature of how they predict and generate answers affects how they function. You can ask the same question and get different answers--how you ask matters.

## DISCUSSION

Vector Math and Gradient Descent
I have spent a lot of time recently relearning (or lets face it, learning for the first time) calculus and differential equations. Most every lawyer I've met always makes the same joke about going to law school to avoid learning math. While it is true, law doesn't require a lot of mathmatical calculations, avoiding understanding of mathematical concepts is becoming more useful. 

Probability

Why it is using so much power to calculate what the next lilkiest word will be


Outline:
- What is AI - Large Language Models
- Why does it matter how it works? - it will help you use it
	- Probablistic models - they are guessing the next word - they are completing the story
	- Know how prompting works
