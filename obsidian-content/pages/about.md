Based in the high desert of Santa Fe, New Mexico, I’ve spent my career navigating two seemingly separate worlds: the high-stakes arena of adversarial litigation and the rapidly evolving frontier of artificial intelligence.

In the courtroom, I am a trial lawyer. My focus is on personal injury and complex torts—cases where individuals have been fundamentally upended by tragedy or negligence. My job is to translate human suffering and legal complexity into a narrative of justice. It’s a role that requires empathy, precision, and an unyielding commitment to my clients.

In the lab and at my keyboard, I am a writer and researcher. I explore how large language models and emerging technologies are reshaping the legal profession. My work centers on the ethical integration of AI into legal workflows, the mitigation of algorithmic bias, and the preservation of human-centric justice in an increasingly automated world.

These paths aren’t as parallel as they seem. Both are about translation: one translates life into law; the other translates law into logic. This site is where those stories meet.
