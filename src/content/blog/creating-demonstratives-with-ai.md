RE: How to use AI tools to help with courtroom visuals

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
How can AI tools help create visual aids and demonstratives for use in trial or depositions?

## SHORT ANSWER: 
Easily create info graphics with your case information or timelines with your client's treatment schedule
## DISCUSSION

AI Image Diffusion Models from major tech firms continue to improve at a rapid pace. From (Sora) to Google's Nano Banana, these images may display some artifacts allowing human to detect that it isn't real, but those days are dwindling. The use of these tools for attorneys doesn't rely on such details or artifacts. Attorneys want demonstratives.

#### Next-Level Demonstratives
While attending a local trial lawyer association AI workgroup discussion, one of the lawyers brought up a use case for image generators--demonstratives during examinations and depositions. 

Consider an expert exam of a construction defect. You can generate extreme examples of problems that go unnoticed.

Consider traffic at an intersection

Consider any obstructed views at intersections. (Create an image for obstructed view, go through your own cases and see what you can determine)

#### Timelines and Infographics created from your case data

Consider creating a medical treatment timeline. You can feed nano banana non-confidential or PII case data, such as general treatment dates or damages amounts and have it generate a professional timeline. You can use this timeline in exams or closing. 

#### The Benefits of Speed

Nano banana can generate images in seconds. In depositions you can generate demonstratives and show them to witnesses. They may or may not be admissible. (check on the admissibility of generated exhibits as demonstratives)
