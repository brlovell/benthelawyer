RE: Will Artificial Super Intelligence end humanity?

## QUESTION PRESENTED: 
What impact does the massive buildout of AI infrastructure and data centers have on your local community.

## SHORT ANSWER: 
It is certainly possible and probable. Without any meaningful regulation or discussion of the risks on an international scale, something negative seems likely. We may be outsmarting ourselves and overestimating our control of the situation. 


If anybody builds it, everyone dies. It's all in the title of the book that sparked this debate

## DISCUSSION
Large AI companies are extracting value from you. This is the playbook of tech companies that inevitably plays out. And I do mean inevitably (link to enshittification). You pay a monthly fee or pay a marginal fee on a case-by-case basis and the company trains their model on your usage. What this ultimately means is that once the model is sufficiently intelligent as a result of your work and usage, the price will increase and its value to you will diminish.

Building custom AI solutions solves this problem. You train and improve your model on your data. You don't depend on a third party with leverage over your data.


The problem with building a custom solution is scalability and maintenance. I use AI tools to solve individual problems and add value tomy cases. Were I to continuously maintain this software with a user base, I would be a software engineer and not a lawyer. I don't want to spend my time tracking and fixing bugs in software.
