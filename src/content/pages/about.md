I work as a plaintiff's trial attorney in New Mexico. I went to law school in Colorado but decided I wanted to practice in New Mexico because I like it here. I spent my time at law school competing in and coaching teams for mock trial tournaments; to me, there is no greater sport.

I worked for the New Mexico Department of Justice as an Assistant Attorney General in Consumer Protection. I loved the work and the lawyers I with whom I worked and from whom I learned. I took advantage of the opportunity to learn from the best lawyers in the country on massive multi-district litigations and I also investigated state businesses accused of wronging the citizens. I learned the legislative process and how difficult it is to fend off legislation backed by industry groups that would harm consumers. I loved working for the state but missed working with clients so I passed on my *parens patriae* duty to the next AAG and moved into private practice with Make Right Law.

I believe in advocacy. I believe that every person has dignity and people who are harmed by negligence deserve an advocate. I work at a specialized litigation firm at our office in Santa Fe and focus on New Mexico. I work with clients harmed by fires in both New Mexico and Texas. I work with clients harmed by trucks on the interstate and trucks on local roads and trucks in parking lots. I love my clients.

I am a musician. I studied classical guitar and worked in marketing and development for an opera festival in the rolling hills of Rappahannock County Virginia. I worked under the baton and direction of Maestro Lorin Maazel. I taught English abroad and guided tourists down rivers in Montana. I even worked as a land man. Then, I went to law school.

I am an interested advocate. Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence research fascinates me. New tools developed over the past few years allow me to answer questions and explore seemingly endless subjects in-depth. I'm determined to understand the latest technology and advances in intelligence because my clients deserve it. I spend time researching ways to incorporate AI tools into my practice to help me better help my clients. I explore using those tools to perform research to answer case related questions and better understand my client's claims. I think often about the ethics involved in this unregulated time. I share what I learn here and on my project portfolio and encourage others to do the same.
